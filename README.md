UT Austin Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide 2023-2024

## Description
This study guide was made to prepare students going into the world of coding before class begins. It, not only, covers the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, the study guide was created by using all four languages. 

Each topic. This allows me to easily look over what I learned throughout the prework, and also go back and edit in what else I will learn thoughout the course. 

I learned Git commands and what they do within gitbash. I also learned the value of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they fit together in order for the study guide webpage to work.
